Just keep in mind that the yellow code always stays on top (well, you don't have to worry about it though, after I have done coding that part out).

This is a purely frontend project using the power of React, Redux and CSS to create several interactions. The code for stacking does not support redraggability, and stays fixed. You gotta double click to carry out actions. 

There are some bugs, that will be fixed as I go along. also the code for Events was causing a lot of problem, so has been removed. The sprite support is as of now of 2. One is Cat and the other is Fish. The reason for why they do not appear together, is pretty obvious I guess. You can go ahead and spin either one of them the way you want to, tell them to go anywhere, or wait for a certain time before doing something, or tell them to carry out as many motions as u can by stacking all the code up! Its obviously not something you gotta do in your free time, but its a good exercise for developers, who will look and go (Hmm.. how did that happen? Oh no, this could have been done better, this code can be great). The goal of the project is to be as feature rich as Scratch but at the same time being better. 

Its a React project so , you can just do npm install and npm start if you want to download and explore yourself. A few contributions maybe wont hurt (I wanna see your ideas in code too now, come on, type it out already).
